## Inline vs. Sanity-Managed Prompts

Prompts can be defined entirely in code, or stored in Sanity and combined with implementation-specific parts inline. The reference implementation uses the hybrid approach.

See [ecommerce/app/src/app/api/chat/route.ts](ecommerce/app/src/app/api/chat/route.ts) (`buildSystemPrompt`).

## Tips for Iterating on System Prompts

1. **Start simple**: Begin with a basic prompt and add specificity as needed
2. **Test edge cases**: Try queries that might confuse the agent
3. **Review tool calls**: Check that the agent uses tools appropriately
4. **Iterate based on failures**: When the agent fails, update the prompt to handle that case
5. **Keep it focused**: A specialized agent often performs better than a generalist
6. **Optimize for production**: Use the [dial-your-context skill](../../dial-your-context/SKILL.md) to build Instructions field content informed by the user's actual dataset structure, and optionally use the [shape-your-agent skill](../../shape-your-agent/SKILL.md) to craft the system prompt
